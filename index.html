            <p style="background-color:blue;color: blanchedalmond;" id=firstp>My name My name is bob marley. My name came from my mom. 
                She wanted Lexey even though it’s a common name, so she spelled it like I’ve never seen before</p>

            <p style="color: cornsilk;
            background-color: darkcyan; font: size 70px; " id=secp>I am very foodie. I love to eat and cook. The food gives us energy.
                 Without food, there is no life. There are so many dishes available in today’s world some 
                 like Indian foods like Biryani, Dosa, Pav Bhaji, Pani Puri etc whereas some like western
                  foods like Pizza, Burger, Noodles etc. Among the number of food, Pizza is my favourite food 
                  because it tastes and smells fabulous.</p>

            <p  style="font-size:160%; background-color:darkslateblue;color: darkgray;" id=therdp>The world of colours comes to being only when light touches it. Without colours, 
                everything in this world is dark and gloomy.
                Color makes things look beautiful and happening.
                 Color is the reason why the world is such a beautiful place.
                Colors are held in different perspectives. They signify different things and they have different purposes</p>

                Age is just a number for those people who really want to achieve their goals. 
                Take an example of a 65-year-old who could not even bend his knees while offering prayer and he 
                changed his life by adopting yoga exercises and now he is amongst the top yoga teachers of the city.</p>
